We are $Bloody Shadow A.N.S#

We did this project thinking about staying anonymous and also making the use we want.

With this tool you can send messages to other people, with the email address you want.

The messages are encrypted from the Tor network, in P2P

We rely on the mail of secmail.pro

To execute the code;

1ª chmod + x *
2ª xxxxxxxxxx?
3ª xxxxxxxxxx?


I am not responsible for anything, for the use that you give to my tool.

This tool is being developed.
