We are $Bloody Shadow A.N.S#

We did this project thinking that we have to remain anonymous and also make the use we want.

With this tool you can send messages to other people, with the email address you want.

The messages are encrypted and are also in the Tor network, in P2P.

We rely on the mail of secmail.pro


To execute the code;

chmod + x *
bash sendmail.sh


Those who did the project, we are not responsible for anything.
